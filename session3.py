#Q1Declare four variables in Python: your age as an int, your height in centimeters as a float, your name as a str, and whether you have a Spotify account as a bool. Print each variable and use the type() function to display its data type.
age=21
height=5.6
name="prachi"
has_spotify=True
print(type(age))
print(type(height))
print(type(name))
print(type(has_spotify))

#Q2 Write a function total_cart_amount(prices) that takes a list of product prices as strings (like ['199.99', '49', '350.75']) and returns the total as a float. Print the result for a sample Flipkart-style cart.<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Use float() to convert each string before summing.</em>
def total_cart_amount(prices):
    total = 0.0

    for price in prices:
        total += float(price)

    return total

cart = ['199.99', '49', '350.75']
print("Total Amount:", total_cart_amount(cart))

#Q3 Create a script that asks the user to input their cricket score as a string, converts it to an int, and prints 'Half-century!' if the score is 50 or more, otherwise prints 'Keep going!'.<br><br><em><strong>Constraint:</strong> Use input(), int(), and if-else.</em>
# score=input("Enter your cricket score")
# score=int(score)
# if score>50:
#     print("Half-century!")
# else:
#     print("keep going!")

#Q4 Given the variable is_premium = 'True' (as a string), write code to correctly convert it to a boolean value and print its type.<br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> The bool() function alone won’t work as expected. Think about string comparison.</em>
is_premium="True"
is_premium=bool(is_premium)
print(is_premium)
print(type(is_premium))
